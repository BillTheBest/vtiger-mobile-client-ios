vtiger-mobile-client-ios
========================

A client for vTigerCRM Mobile API written in Objective-C, built for iOS.

My analysis and exploration of vTiger Mobile API is published at this GitHub page: [http://gixworks.github.io/vtiger-mobile-client-ios/](http://gixworks.github.io/vtiger-mobile-client-ios/)

**Please note that this library is still under heavy development**

I am currently using it for the iOS app [ContactiCal](http://www.contactic.al), that you can try it for free in Beta by signing up [here](http://eepurl.com/SyR6b)!
