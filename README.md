vtiger-mobile-client-ios
========================

A client for vTigerCRM Mobile API written in Objective-C, built for iOS.

My analysis and exploration of vTiger Mobile API is published at this GitHub page: [http://gixworks.github.io/vtiger-mobile-client-ios/](http://gixworks.github.io/vtiger-mobile-client-ios/)

**Please note that this library is still under heavy development**

I am currently using it for the iOS app [ContactiCal](http://www.contactic.al), that can be downloaded on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/contactical-for-vtiger-crm/id879934819?l=en&mt=8)!
